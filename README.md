# Final Selected Themes:
Human Healthcare and Living Wellbeings
# Title of The Project:
Anabul
# Summary of Project:
The pet economy industry in Indonesia experienced growth during the Covid-19 pandemic, causing the habit of adopting animals to increase. Data from LandX in 2021 shows that 47% of respondents keep cats, and 10% of respondents keep dogs at home. The problem statement of this project is that many people have difficulty finding knowledge such as cat/dog classifications, breeds, food types, and diseases. In addition, the number of abandoned animals causes the need for an application with social features such as adoption, donation, and consultation. Research questions are how do cat/dog lovers find knowledge related to the classification of cats and dogs along with their breeds to food type information? How do we integrate the application's social features, such as adoption, donation, and consultation? What is the impact of this application on the community of cat and dog lovers in Indonesia? Background 
information is that there are many characteristics, uniqueness, and types of cats and dogs that are complicated and time-consuming to learn. This project should be completed to make it easier for cat and dog lovers to find knowledge about cats and dogs integrated with social features such as adoption, donation, and consultation. This project should be completed to make it easier for cat and dog lovers to find knowledge about cats and dogs integrated with social features such as adoption, donation, and consultation.
